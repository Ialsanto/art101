			<h1>Lab 4 - psuedocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Getting familiar with psuedocoding and planning before diving into the code </p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didnt have any problems typing out the pseudocode for the checkers game the first game we thought about was chess 
						but with all the rules that each individual piece has we scraped it and went with checkers maybe in the future we look 
						at chess for practice</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Having coded before I understand what pseudocode is intended for and how useful it is in solving problems we are unfamiliar with.
						 This lab was broken into 5 different parts quiding us through the steps of creating pseudocode. Although there has been little to know code 
						being written I have learned a bit more about what comes before the Implementation </p>
